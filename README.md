To get the new day's puzzle, run `just new_day <day>`. This will create a new
cargo project in the directory `day_<day>`. The puzzle input will be downloaded
to `day_<day>/README.md`.

The inputs are stored in the `inputs` directory. The inputs are named
`example_<part>.txt` and `full.txt` for the personalized test one.

To test the solution, run `just test <day>`.

## TODO

- [x] Create a new day
- [x] Download the input
- [x] Create a test
- [x] Run the test
- [x] Run the solution
- [ ] Submit the solution
