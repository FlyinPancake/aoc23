To get the new day's puzzle, run `just new_day <day>`. This will create a new
cargo project in the directory `day_<day>`. The puzzle input will be downloaded
to `day_<day>/README.md`.

The inputs are stored in the `inputs` directory. The inputs are named
`example_<part>.txt` and `full.txt` for the personalized test one.

To test the solution, run `just test <day>`.

## Note on personal inputs

The personal inputs in the repository are the intellectual property of the creators of Advent of Code. I do not own them, and I do not claim to own them. I have included them in this repository for my own convenience and reproducibility, and I will remove them if asked to do so by the creators of Advent of Code.
